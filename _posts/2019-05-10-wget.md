title: Explaining the WGET Assignment

After visiting the website of the [Perseus Collection of the Richmond Times Dispatch](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/collection?collection=Perseus:collection:RichTimes)
we found out that the URLs of the XML versions of the individual issues are of the following format: 

http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/dltext?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a2006.05.0001  

After checking out the source of the main page, we found out that links to the individual issues are written in this format:  

\<a href="text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a2006.05.0001" class="aResultsHeader">The Daily Dispatch: November 1, 1860., [Electronic resource]</a>.  

Therefore, I opened the source HTML file in Sublime and made a Find All query using the following RegEx to sort out the relevant part of the links:

`text\?doc.+(\.\d\d\d\d)`  

By this I received the following format: text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a2006.05.0001, pasting all of it into a new text file.

After this I made the following Replace All query using RegExes:

Find All: `^text`
Replace All: `http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/dltext`

I saved it in .txt format and used the file in the WGET scheme `wget -i links.txt -P ./folderYouWantToSaveTo/ -nc`.
