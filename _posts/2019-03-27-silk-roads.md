title: The Origin and Meaning of the Concept "Silk Road(s)"
---

The Silk Road, or more correctly Silk _Roads_ are a network of trade routes connecting various parts of Eurasia since ancient times. However, the name "Silk Road" is a relatively recent invention, coined by German geographer Ferdinand von Richthofen in the 1870's (in German: _Seidenstraße_). Nevertheless, translations of the name were successfully popularized in non-European languages as well, such as e.g. _sichou zhi lu_ 丝绸之路 ("The Road of Silk") in Chinese.
