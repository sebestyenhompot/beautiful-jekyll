## Sinac Grammar
### Nouns
Similarly to Hungarian, Chinese, and many other non-Indo-European and non-Semitic languages, Sinac has no grammatical genders. The plural of nouns is formed
by adding *-n* to their stem, in case of some letters *-en* to make the pronunciation easier (e.g. the plural of *heśś* is *heśśen*). This was
apparently influenced by German, in which *-en* is also a frequent suffix of the plural.  
The definite article has various forms, which are determined by its position and by the words which precede and follow it. 
The basic form of the definite article is *e*. In case it is at the beginning of the sentence, or it is preceded by a word which
ends with a vowel, it changes to *je*. In case it is in front of a word which starts with a vowel, it changes to *ey* (cf. Hungarian
*a* vs. *az*). If both conditions are true, it takes the form *jey*. See e.g.:  
>***je** kástroo / **jey** eap / je kástroo at **ey** eap / jey eap at **e** kástroo* (the school / the class / the school and the class / 
the class and the school) 
The indefinite article (the equivalent of English *a/an* has only one form, *ter*. This comes from an abbreviation of the word *muuter* meaning *one*.

### Prepositions, postpositions, prefixes, and suffixes added to nouns
While German and English use mostly prepositions added in front of the nouns (in, under/unter, between/zwischen, etc.), in Hungarian everything is added at 
the end of the nouns, either in the form of suffixes (e.g. -hoz/-hez/-höz) or in the form of postpositions (... alatt, között). In Sinac, I
decided to mix up these two ways of dealing with
