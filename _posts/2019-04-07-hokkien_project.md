title: The Hokkien Dictionaries and Textbooks Project
---

Hokkien (a.k.a. Minnan 閩南話, Southern Min, Taiwanese) is a variety of Chinese spoken in the southern part of Fujian province (China), Taiwan and by a large number of overseas Chinese all over Southeast Asia.
Hokkien dictionaries and textbooks have been published since the 16th century in a number of locations and in a variety of languages (Classical Chinese, Dutch, English, Hokkien, Japanese, Latin, Mandarin, Spanish) for purposes such as education for locals, Christian missionary work and colonial administration.  

In this post I would like to share a database project I created for the "Working with Digital Data for Historians" class taught by Prof. Tara Andrews at Uni Vienna in the autumn semester of 2018/19. The project work is based on my 3-years MA studies at Xiamen University (Fujian prov., China) and is connected to an article of mine already peer-reviewed and accepted for publication in the journal _Crossroads - Studies on the History of Exchange Relations in the East Asian World_.
The database is an Excel spreadsheet-based SQL database containing 121 titles of Hokkien linguistic works, connected to relevant information (author, place/date of publishing, publisher, language, transcription method, etc.).  

A dump version of the database can be accessed [here](/img/Hokkien_dump_by_Sebestyen_Hompot.sql).  

A zip collection of the contents (project description, the original Excel spreadsheets, the SQL schema and the .ipynb documentation of the creation of the database via Jupyter Notebook) can be found [here](/img/Hokkien_project_by_Sebestyen_Hompot.zip).  

Since my research work in Xiamen was focused on the pre-WWII period, information regarding post-WWII works is still insufficient in the database. Therefore, this database is up for further expansion.
