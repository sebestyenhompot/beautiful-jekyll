title: The Hokkien Dictionaries and Textbooks Project
---

Today I published my project created for the ["Working with Digital Data for Historians"](https://ufind.univie.ac.at/en/course.html?lv=070017&semester=2018W) course of last semester at Zenodo. The project is based on my 3-year-long MA studies at Xiamen University (China) and included an SQL database of dictionaries and textbooks of Hokkien, the local variety of Chinese, also spoken in Taiwan and among overseas Chinese all over Southeast Asia. The project is also related to an article of mine soon to be published in [*Crossroads - Studies on the History of Exchange Relations in the East Asian World*](http://www.eacrh.net/).
