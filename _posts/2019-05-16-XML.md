### 1/A. Creating the cleaned copies of the Perseus XML files
For creating the cleaned copies of the Perseus XML files, I took the following steps:  

1. Importing the RegEx module into Python: `import re`.  

2. To make things easier, defining the path of the folder used for this excercise: `folder_path = 'C:\\Users\\Siming\\Desktop\\siming\\AC_studies\\Tools and Techniques for Digital Humanities\\Perseus\\Perseus_XML\\'`.  

3. Importing the OS (Operation System) module and listing files in the folder with the 'listdir' function, followed by printing the full paths of the files to check the results:  
```python
import os
lof = os.listdir(folder_path)
for file in lof:
    print(folder_path+file)
```
    
4. I created a loop for opening and reading each file of the list, saved the results in data2, used the re.sub function, 
created a new dataset after removing the XML tags, named the new files by adding "_modified.xml" to the original filename 
and wrote the new files:
```python
for file in lof:
    with open(folder_path+file, "r", encoding="utf8") as f2:
        data2 = f2.read()
    dataNew2 = re.sub("<[^<]+>", "", data2)
    newFN = file + "_modified.xml"
    with open(newFN, "w", encoding="utf8") as f3:
        f3.write(dataNew2)
```

I could not, however, figure out how to set the target folder for the new files, therefore it was by default saved into my
`Documents` folder. Using 'date of creation' based listing, I selected the new files manually and moved them into a new folder
created for this assignment.  


### 1/B. Splitting issues into articles
I figured out that the publication date is included in each issue after the tag <date value>, between the tags </pubPlace> and the following "authname". Therefore I used the re.search function with the apprpriate RegEx in the following way:  
```python
    with open(folder_path+file, "r", encoding="utf8") as f2:
        data2 = f2.read()
        issue_dates = re.search(r"</pubPlace> <date value=\"(.*)\" authname", data2).group(1)
        print(issue_dates)
```  
Regarding the splitting of the issues into articles, the tag <div3> signals the start of a new article. I managed to split one issue into
constituent articles with the re.split method, splitting the issue at </div3>:  
```python
    with open(folder_path+"dltext@doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2006.05.0001", "r", encoding="utf8") as text_split1:
    data_split1 = text_split1.read()
    results_split1 = re.split("</div3>", data_split1)
```  
According to my logic, to split all the issues into articles would have required to pass the same command on the entire `lof` list, defined for the first assignment. However, for reasons I could not figure out, this method only split one article at a time, instead of the entire list.  
Regarding the counter, I would use the logic learned at Codecademy:  
```python
    def counter(issues):
        total = 0
        for issue in issues:
            total += 1
        return total
```  
Removing the XML tags would involve the same command as in the first excercise (`re.sub("<[^<]+>", "", data)`).
