title: Georeferencing Assignment: Fourty cities you would not think are located (also) in the U.S.
---

For the georeferencing assignment I used two old maps (one dated to 1843, the other not dated) of the United States.
I found it exciting that **many cities in the U.S. are actually named after cities in other countries**.  

For obvious historical reasons, British cities play prominently (Liverpool and Manchaster apparently have several twins on the other side of the Atlantic) but
there are also many city names of Greek background (Athens, Ithaca, at least two Spartas) and others with origins from countries as diverse as India,
Poland and Saudi Arabia (Delhi, at least three Warsaws, Medina). **Vienna** also has its twin city located in [Illinois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna,_Illinois).  

It is also worth mentioning that some cities appearing on these 19th century maps are not inhabited anymore, such as this ghost-town version of [Belgrade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgrade,_Texas) in Texas, destroyed during the Civil War.

I hereby submit the screenshots and CSV texts of my assignment:

Meanwhile, I would also like to point out some problems I came across during completing the assignment.
Since both maps have a coordinate system I did the georeferncing by choosing
