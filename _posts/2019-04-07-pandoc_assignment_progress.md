title: Pandoc assignment
---

After creating the Markdown version of the assigned text (by McCarty) I was able to convert it to PDF using pandoc (except for the Greek letters):

[McCarty.pdf](/img/HOMPOT_Pandoc_assignment_v1.pdf)

I was able to create the HTML file as well, however, it remained in plain text format:

[McCarty.html](/img/HOMPOT_Pandoc_assignment_v1.html)

As for the DOCX version, although the file was created, after opening I received the error message "the file is corrupted and cannot be opened" without any further explanation.
At the class I did not have any problems and I did everything using the same commands as during the class. I also followed the template while editing the Markdown file. 
I hope to find out during the next class what caused these problems.
