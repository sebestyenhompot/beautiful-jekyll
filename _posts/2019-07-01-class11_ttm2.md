title: Class 11 Text-to-map Assignment No. 2.
---

The assignment for class 11 is mostly based on the same code as used for class 10. Since I have already explained it in the [previous post](https://sebestyenhompot.github.io/2019-05-30-text_to_map/), I will focus on the additional lines necessary to create frequency/coordinate dictionaries fall all months and days (for years they were already created in the previous assignment).
I had to use the already created `generate` function to create frequency lists for all days and months instead of only for the years.
To create sequences of months and days between two dates, I used a method learned from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28042298/how-to-generate-a-range-of-yyyymm-values?lq=1):
```python
#Method for creating yyyy-mm format sequence between 1860-11 and 1865-12:
import datetime as dt
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta

list_months = []

yyyymm_1 = '186011'
yyyymm_2 = '186512'

MONTH = relativedelta(months=+1)

fmt = '%Y%m'
date_1 = dt.datetime.strptime(yyyymm_1, fmt).date()
date_2 = dt.datetime.strptime(yyyymm_2, fmt).date()

d = date_1

while d <= date_2:
    print(d.strftime('%Y')+"-"+d.strftime('%m'))
    
    d += MONTH

#The variation of the method for creating yyyy-mm-dd format sequence between 1860-11-01 and 1866-01-01:
import datetime as dt
from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta

yyyymm_1 = '186011'
yyyymm_2 = '186601'

DAYS = relativedelta(days=+1)

fmt = '%Y%m'
date_1 = dt.datetime.strptime(yyyymm_1, fmt).date()
date_2 = dt.datetime.strptime(yyyymm_2, fmt).date()

d = date_1

while d <= date_2:
    print(d)

    d += DAYS
```
After printing out the yyyy-mm and yyyy-mm-dd sequences in Jupyter Notebook, I copy-pasted them into Sublime Text and using the regular expressions
FIND ALL `^\d` REPLACE ALL WITH `generate("1` and FIND ALL `\n` REPLACE ALL WITH `")\n`, I obtained sequences of the following format which can be pasted into jupyter notebook:

generate("1860-11")  
[...]  
generate("1865-12");  

generate("1860-11-01")  
[...]  
generate("1865-12-01")  

The results look like this:  

![](/img/generate1.png)  

![](/img/generate2.png)  

This is followed by applying the `match` function to all the generated files (based on months/days):
```python
import os

target2 = "path_to_files"

lof2 = os.listdir(target2)

dictionary = loadTGN(target+"tgn_data_light.tsv")

for file in lof2:
  match(file, dictionary)
```
