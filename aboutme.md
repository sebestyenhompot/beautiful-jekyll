### Introduction
I am currently enrolled for the second year of the Erasmus Mundus Global Studies MA program at the University of Vienna. I have a research interest in global history with a focus on China, especially the exchange of goods, ideas and migration in pre-modern times. I created this website as an assignment of a digital tools & techniques class at the University of Vienna and I plan to share contents related to my research interests.
