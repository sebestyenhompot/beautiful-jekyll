### Introduction
I am currently enrolled for the second year of the Erasmus Mundus Global Studies MA program at the University of Vienna. I have been admitted to the PhD program in Sinology at the University of Vienna starting from October 2019. My primary research interest is global history with a focus on China, especially the exchange of goods, ideas and migration in pre-modern times. I created this website as an assignment of a digital tools & techniques course at the University of Vienna and will share my solutions for the assignments of the course here.

### Current project
Currently I am working on my MA thesis.
